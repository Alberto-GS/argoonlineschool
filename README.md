# Argo Online School

In this repository you can find the python jupyter notebooks that are part of the Argo Online school. These notebooks are based on <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euroargodev/argopy/master/docs/_static/argopy_logo_long.png" alt="argopy logo" width="100"/>, [the Argo data python library](https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy), and cover the following lessons:

## Usage
First, I suggest to create a python enviroment to use these notebooks. To create, and activate, the enviroment AOS [stand for Argo Online School]:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate AOS
```
This enviroment already includes argopy stable version.

Then, you can download the following jupyter notebooks, one for each lesson.
