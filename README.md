# Argo Online School

In this repository you can find the python jupyter notebooks that are part of the Argo Online school. These notebooks are based on <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euroargodev/argopy/master/docs/_static/argopy_logo_long.png" alt="argopy logo" width="100"/>, [the Argo data python library](https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy), and cover the following lessons:

### netCDF format description.

### Basics of netCDF.

### Using netcdf data.

### Data files organization (local computer).

### Real time data and delayed mode data.

### Using quality control flags.

### How to take advantage of Argo data.

### Scientific examples. Product generation.


## Usage
First, I suggest to create a python enviroment to use these notebooks. To create, and activate, the enviroment AOS [stand for Argo Online School]:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate AOS
```
This enviroment already includes argopy stable version

As a very useful first aproach to python, heere, you can find [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro) developed by [Ryan Abernathey](https://ocean-transport.github.io/) and Kerry Key.
