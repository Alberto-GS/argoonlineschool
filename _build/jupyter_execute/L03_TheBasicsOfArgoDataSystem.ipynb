    "When an Argo float surfaces, the data are received by one of the *Data Assembly Centers* (DAC). At the DACs, they are subjected to initial scrutiny using a set of real time quality control tests where erroneous data are flagged or corrected, then the data are passed to one of the two Argo *Global Data Assembly Center* (GDAC), the Coriolis GDAC (Brest, France, Europe) or the US-Godae GDAC (Mobterey, California, USA). \n",

The target is for these *real-time* data to be available within 24 hours of their transmission from the float."

    "There are also several index files in the top directory containing a list of metadata on each type of Argo data file (meta, prof, tech and traj) contained in the \"dac\" and \"geo\" folders. It is possible to download these lists and search them for floats in specific regions, times, DACs, etc. There is also a grelist which contains a list of floats that likely have sensor problems. We will describe this files later.\n",
