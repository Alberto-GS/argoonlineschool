    "When an Argo float surfaces, the data are received by one of the *Data Assembly Centers* (DAC). At the DACs, they are subjected to initial scrutiny using a set of real time quality control tests where erroneous data are flagged or corrected, then the data are passed to one of the two Argo *Global Data Assembly Center* (GDAC), the Coriolis GDAC (Brest, France, Europe) or the US-Godae GDAC (Mobterey, California, USA). \n",

The target is for these *real-time* data to be available within 24 hours of their transmission from the float."
