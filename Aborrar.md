A long life float is the WMO 6901472 (with almost all the core BGC variables except pH) I don't know if you aware of that regarding BGC floats but the parameters are not systematically aligned (with the same pressure levels) so maybe a good alternative is to use the Sprof profile (for which a work was done to optimize the alignment) they are easier to use and stored in the same directory in the GDAC

you can see some illustrations here of the float I mentioned (just to know that at the end of the float life some data are not so good, so you should check the QC) (click on the Time series link)

here you will have all the bibliography with bgc-Argo
